**PART 2**

For the second half of the quarter, I learned a lot of technical things using the terminal. I learned new command lines and vim which was cool. In general, I believe the layout of the class really helped me understand the concepts of files and directories, and it made me become a better coder in general now that I am familiar with the technicalities of the "behind-the-scenes" of programming. The labs definitely fostered my learning curve in handling software tools and shortcuts that makes my life a little better when coding.
