Helena Phamova - **CSE 15L Lab Report 2**

---

Hello this is my second lab report for CSE 15L!


**PART 1**


**PART 2**


**PART 3**

I have definitely learned more commands over the past couple of weeks and solidified the meaning of each of them and what they stand for. For example for the longest time, I always saw people using cd, but I always forget that it stands for change directory. I also learned that once you remember all the commands by heart, navigating yourself through the terminal/command prompt is certainly more efficient. In addition to that, I learned how to connect to a remote computer with ease, knowing what each step entails.
